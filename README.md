### Semantic Elements
Semantic elements are more readable than non-semantic HTML. They provide great accessibility for screen readers. Semantic elements refer to the purpose or role that the element has.

These are common semantic elements:

```
<article>
<aside>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
```
